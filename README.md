# Chit Funds on Blockchain

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Chit Funds on Blockchain project! This initiative harnesses the power of blockchain technology to establish a decentralized and secure platform for chit funds. Chit funds are a popular financial model where a group of individuals collaborates for a defined period, contributing fixed amounts regularly. Each period, one member receives the entire collected sum, and this cycle continues until every participant receives the corpus.

## Features

- **Decentralized Chit Fund Management**: Utilizes blockchain technology for secure and transparent chit fund management.
- **Smart Contracts with Solidity**: Implements smart contracts using Solidity, ensuring trust and reliability in fund transactions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is crafted with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to provide an intuitive and responsive experience.
- **Next.js for Frontend Development**: Leverages Next.js, a React-based framework, for efficient and performant frontend development.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: HyperText Markup Language for structuring web pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for client-side logic.
- **Next.js**: React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications.
- **Solidity**: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
